# Simulating Adaptive Clinical Trials - Where to Start and How to Expand
This repository is an introduction to simulation of adaptive clinical trials.  You can find YouTube videos that utilize this 
repository and explain each of the examples.  The videos are part of the ASA Biopharmaceutical Section located at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Tkg5b3QR8fXWsTBYerCng.

Code Template - The starting point for the example.  Only code examples, not complete functions. 

Example 1: A fixed sample design that only conducts the analysis at the end of the study.  This example will serve as the starting points for developing more complex simulations.  In this folder, there is a StartTemplate and Solutions folders.   For this example, start in the StartTemplate directory and use it as a guide for developing your own R code.   The worked solution is located in the Solution folder.
