# Simulating Adaptive Clinical Trials - Where to Start and How to Expand
This repository is an introduction to simulation of adaptive clinical trials.  You can find YouTube videos that utilize this 
repository and explain each of the examples.  The videos are part of the ASA Biopharmaceutical Section located at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Tkg5b3QR8fXWsTBYerCng

Code Template - The starting point for the example.  Only code examples, not complete functions. 

Example 1: A fixed sample design that only conducts the analysis at the end of the study.  This example will serve as the starting points for developing more complex simulations.
