# Introduction to Bayesian Clinical Trial Simulation
This repository is an introduction to software development in R for simulation of clinical trials.
 
Example 1: A fixed sample design that only conducts the analysis at the end of the study.

Example 2: Incorporate the adaptive randomization feature and make the time to observe the patients' outcome random.

Example 3: Extend the previous examples to include early stopping and a ramp up in accrual.
